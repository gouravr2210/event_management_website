# event_management_website
I've created a event management website here
Event Module:
â€¢ Description: This module keeps students informed about upcoming events and facilitates 
event management.
1) Event Updates: Students receive updates on various college events, including 
workshops, seminars, and social gatherings.
2) Registration: Students can register for events directly through the website.
3) Automated Lists: Registered students are automatically added to event 
coordinators' lists, streamlining event management.
4) Teacher Tracking: Teachers can monitor the number of students participating in 
an event by selecting the class name.
